DATA TYPES:
    
    int:
        Stores a regular integer. Default size is 32 bits.

    double:
        Holds a large floating point number.

    char:
        Holds a single 1 byte charachter.

    void:
        Indicates no type.

    enum:
        Enumerated types. Works as integers, convert to integers.

TYPE MODIFIERS:

    unsigned:
        Changes the type so that it does not have negative numbers.
    
    signed:
        Gives the type both positive and negative numbers.
    
    long:
        Uses a larger storage for the type so that it can hold bigger numbers.
    
    short:
        Uses smaller storage for the type so it stores less but 
        also takes less space
    
TYPE QUALIFIERS:

    const:
        Indicates that the variable can not change after is has been
        initialized
    
    volatile:
        Indicates that the compiler shouldnt try to optimize the variable/function
    
    register:
        Force the compiler to keep this variable in a register.

TYPE CONVERSION:
    C uses a sort of "stepped type promotion" mechanism, 
    where it looks at two operands on either side of an expression, 
    and promotes the smaller side to match the larger side before 
    doing the operation

    if we have:
        long + char - int * double
    then do this:
        (double)long - (double)char - (double)int * double
    to explicitly cast everything end be sure that it is what we want

    IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROMOTE UP I.E CHAR TO LONG 

TYPE SIZES:

    int8_t: 8 bit signed integer

    uint8_t: 8 bit unsigned integer

    int16_t: 16 bit signed integer

    uint16_t: 16 bit unsigned integer

    int32_t: 32 bit signed integer

    uint32_t: 32 bit unsigned integer

    int64_t: 64 bit signed integer

    uint64_t: 64 bit unsigned integer

    general pattern: (u)int(BITS)_t
    u = signed/unsigned
    BITS = number of bits

    macros:
        INT(N)_MAX = max positive number of signed integer of N bits.

        INT(N)_MIN = max negative number of signed integer of N bits.

        UINT(N)_MAX = max positive number of unsigned integer of N bits
